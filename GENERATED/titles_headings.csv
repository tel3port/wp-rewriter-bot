apartment review – travel,"I have been house hunting lately, for a 2-3 bedroom apartment in Nairobi. My search was mostly focused in areas around my work place, and with a certain budget in mind.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
I have come across many decent apartments, very many. During my search I noticed that most of the vacant units were in the upmarket areas – Westlands, Kileleshwa, Hurlingham, Kilimani..just to mention a few. 
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
I decided to dig a bit deeper, to understand why exactly this was the trend. My analysis yielded interesting results.In one search, of 13,164 vacant properties available for rent, 73% were in upmarket areas of Westlands, Lavington, Kilimani, Kileleshwa, Runda and Karen. See the below breakdown:In the above search, the source does not differentiate between main houses and apartments. All the same, the findings can be summarised as below;
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
In a different search, I found that more than 65% of vacant rental apartments in Nairobi are in the aforementioned upmarket areas, with another 15% in areas around Langata, Nairobi south and west and Mombasa road area in general.

This particular source differentiates between main houses and apartments, giving us more accurate results for apartments. 
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
Now, why do we have so many vacant rental apartments in these upmarket areas of Nairobi?The average monthly rent for a 3 bedroom apartment is those areas is around Kshs 90,000/- and Kshs 70,000/- for a 2 bedroom.Of the 1,534 rental apartments in Nairobi, 1,173 (76%) of them are going for 50k and more in terms of monthly rent. About 1,090 (71%) rental apartments are going for 70k and more in terms of monthly rent.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
Not to mention the other highly priced rental apartments in those areas, charging a monthly rent of between 200k and 602kSupply vs demandIn an ideal marketplace, the price for a good or a service is determined by the forces of supply and demand. In a competitive market, the price of a good will vary and settle at a point where the supply of that good equals the demand for it.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
In Nairobi we are at a time when the supply of rental apartments outstrips the demand for them. Ideally the property owners could lower the rent they charge to attract more customers. This is however debatable, with so many other factors in play such as return on investments and market value of the property.In another post, I will look at the value of apartments, in particular those available for purchase.In the meantime have your say, why do we have so many vacant apartments in the upmarket areas?

s7 review – travel,"A subdued Laure gets roasted by Acting Divisional Commander Anfrey from Disciplinary, as Tintin looks on – how does he really feel about his former colleagues? Their questioners fail to divide and conquer Laure and Gilou, who know the routine only too well. But it’s a huge humiliation when their offices are searched. Fortunately, Ali seems to have moved the cash which Laure had left in her filing cabinet, so the two are off the hook for the moment – but Anfrey and TinTin keep tabs on them.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
Tintin, though, destroys evidence that might point to their guilt – is he covering for them, or trying to get them under his thumb?Ali is certainly learning to bend the rules, promising papers for the Syrian immigrants if they tell what they know about the kidnap of Mazouz – DNA evidence links it to Herville’s murder, so it gets top priority. When a witness describes in English the kidnap driver wearing a ‘smoking’, he uses a French colloquialism for a dress jacket. He identifies David Cann’s driver Vadim from photographs. Could Vadim also have been Herville’s executioner?Roban orders the teams to cooperate in a raid on Chen, seemingly unaware that Laure and Gilou are under the cosh – but their plan is working. Money man Cann and his contact Chen are falling out over the missing cash.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
When the raid on Chen is cancelled on orders from above, Roban confronts the Commissioner with the email evidence that led to the death of Herville – reluctantly, the Commissioner agrees to let the raids go ahead, despite his fears that it will cause political repercussions. Sometimes we have to disobey order, says Roban – well, he should know.Josephine’s case is floundering because she can’t get Lola to admit her childhood rape – even when Lola’s mother turns up, it doesn’t help. She turns to Edelman for ethical advice – his retort being to ask since when ethics bothered her? – but in the end she can’t force herself to give away Lola’s secret in court. But Lola finally reveals the truth, and the tribunal, implausibly, softens and hands out a suspended sentence. We doubt if a jury would have been so easily swayed. Josephine and Lola are jubilant, but what of the dead man’s grieving wife?The raid on Chen’s finds stacks of cash, Chen is put under pressure and David Cann panics, telling his wife – Mazouz’s sister – to disappear, not mentioning of course that it’s he who kidnapped Mazouz, and will probably bump him off if he starts to look like a loose end.

(Incidentally, we only just caught on that Mikaël Fitoussi, who plays Mazouz, is the brother of Grégory Fitoussi, who played advocate Pierre Clément in seasons 1-5 of Spiral).We still think, though, that Mazouz’s girlfriend Nadia knows more than she’s letting on, particularly about the killing of her son Fouad."

mandazi recipe – travel,"Apart from being the easiest breakfast recipe, maandazi are delicious and can be prepared in any flavor you like.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
I particularly enjoy Lemon Maandazis, the lemon zest adds a pop in the taste. You can alternate the lemon zest with any fruit flavor or spice like a cardamoms or nutmeg.PREPARATION : You will need some oil for deep frying. The amount of oil will depend on the number of maandazi you intend to fit in the frying pan. Just ensure that the oil is enough to float/ keep the maandazi from touching the bottom of the pan.Also, set aside some time to allow the dough to rest after kneading. The dough may rest longer than 1 hr.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
Once done.. Keep the maandazis in a zip lock bag or in a dish/airtight container to keep them fresh and moist.**NOTE.I used the standard 200gms measuring cups/spoons and not tea cups.

travel,"A-Q & M.I Abaga – The Live Report (EP Review) – Hip-Hop is not dead!
Zhajj_ EPs & Mixtapes, Nigerian, Uncategorized April 17, 2020 4 Minutes
GENRE – Rap/Hip-Hop
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
EP RATING – 9/10Listen HereWhat happens when two OGs of the Hip-Hop game come together to drop a project? What happened when Kanye and Jay Z dropped a collab project? or when Lil Wayne and Birdman came together in ’06? What would happen if Drake and K. Lamar did a joint project? – Yeah, an explosion of Hip-Hop Bliss is what happens.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
It seemed far fetched when M.I jokingly teased A-Q for a collab project on Twitter. Far fetched because it’s just April and they’ve both released successful, individual 2020 projects of their own. M.I released ‘Judah the EP‘ which is still doing well on streaming platforms while fellow MC, A-Q dropped ‘God’s Engineering‘ who although is running the numbers as well too, claimed it to be his last Album ever. So How was a joint Collab going to materialize in less than 7 days amidst all these?
Best Believe the Joint Project we thought wasn’t going to happen is the reason this article happened. ‘THE LIVE REPORT‘, a joint project between A-Q and M.I Abaga dropped one week after they agreed to do it. Yes, you heard right, this whole EP was done and dusted in a week!There has been a recurring notion in the country recently about the Hip-Hop culture being in a regressing state, about Supposed-to-be rappers joining the mainstream community – about rappers not going hardcore and raw like they should. While this notion has got some truth in it, enough credit hasn’t been given to rappers who have kept the Hip-Hop Culture alive, rappers like M.I, Vector, A-Q, Paybac, SDC, Jagz, Boogey, Terry, Alpha Ojini and others I might have forgotten to mention.The Live Report is more than just a joint rap project, it’s about keeping the Hip-Hop game alive and running, it’s about retaining the culture for the upcoming rappers to see and learn from. For M.I, it’s been about retaining his ‘Best Rapper‘ title and making sure he’s not caught slipping, while for A-Q, it’s been about getting the flowers he deserves, getting more recognition and respect for his amazing style of Rap/Hip-Hop . While both sides were unified on this EP, a whole lot of other things made this project stand out.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
One of the most important factors when cooking a project up is its Production and Sound Engineering, you could have the best punchlines in the world, and it just wouldn’t sound right if the production is inadequate or isn’t in sync with the style of rap technique. The 6-track EP is produced by BeatsByJayy and Engineered by Jude Abaga himself, so you just know the production aspect of this project is impeccable with that kind of combo."

Cow liver is a superfood rich in Iron, Proteins and Vitamins.

You can do this with milk too.

Lucky enough, my local butcher always removes the thin clear film on the liver so qI didn’t have to do it. If your liver has this.. ensure that you peel it off because it makes the liver chewy when cooked.Lastly, cut the liver in medium chunks to avoid drying out when cooking.Let`s begin;

lambo review – travel,"Lamborghini Huracan Performante: Review
Lamborghini Huracan Performante: Review
FEBRUARY 20, 2018 ~ TOMS CHIT CHAT
I’m back to my speciality again this week.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
I think it’s time to review a car which we all dream of, yet, can’t possibly afford; the supercar. The new Lamborghini in fact, which is actually very new indeed, as it was only released earlier this year. It is the newest sibling to the older, Lamborghini Huracan, which when it was first released, was a car I didn’t like very much. I know that being a petrol-head and saying you hate a car, specifically a supercar is the same as Sir David Attenborough saying “I HATE THE ENVIRONMENT!” It doesn’t sound right at all. Hear me out on this, I have always admired Lamborghini’s, they are the kind of car that every nine-year-old boy dreams of, and wants the bedroom poster up on his wall. This was the exact case with the Lamborghini Aventador, it’s a few years old now (2012/13), but it is still, and I think always will be for me, the car I have always wanted. And the car which is the most jaw-dropping to look at, which is why as a nine-year-old boy, I had the bedroom wall poster of the Lambo Aventador.Image result for Lamborghini Aventador
Lamborghini Aventador Pic: Lamborghini
There was just always something about this car that looked angry, and that if you tried to stroke it, you always got the feeling that it would bite your arm off. And that’s what Lamborghini’s should always be, an experience that makes you finish with your trousers not being the original colour they were when you started.If I were to be a Lamborghini designer, I would simply do as they do, and not give a toss as to what goes where. Since I’ve been in a few Lamborghini’s before, you do get the sense that the ludicrous Italians that design these simply say; “ah yes, give the wheels ah fire blades, and ah, lasers for windscreen wipers, ah! Molto Bene!” That’s how all Lamborghini’s should be designed.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
This was not the case, however, for the Huracan. I was never really sure what it was about that car, but, after Lamborghini made the Aventador it seemed like the sky was the limit. When the Huracan rolled off the production line, there was just something missing that I couldn’t really put my finger on. Compared to the Aventador, the Huracan didn’t have the same drop-jaw look that the Aventador owned. You wouldn’t imagine the Huracan being the amazingly framed bedroom wall poster that it’s big brother got.
The Huracan on the streets of London
I got to go in this very car in fact, which is why the caption doesn’t have any photo credits because I took this picture myself on my iPhone, after my scary stint around London’s streets.Related image
Lamborghini Huracan Performante Pic: Car and Driver
A standard Lamborghini Huracan will cost £155,000, and the all-new Performante is a whopping £55,000 more expensive, at £208,000. So, what do you get for your money? Well, it seems that on paper, not much."
covid 19 – travel,"Back in 2017, as a requirement of a degree of Masters of Science in Food Safety and Quality, I was privileged to join my class in a one week community outreach and assessment program in Kwale County. The one week assessment interrogated community food handling and safety knowledge to tackle the increasing cases of malnutrition and periodical cholera cases experienced in the county during that period. The one week interaction with the Mijikenda (nine sub tribes) gave me an endowed experience and a burning desire to make a trip again at the Kenyan coast and learn more about the communal orientation of the community. The dream got actualized when, fortunately, I merited as one of the students in the cassava project. This time, the trip was not to Kwale but to two other counties, Kilifi and Taita-Taveta, which boarder Kwale.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
In my earlier years, I lived having two perceptions about the Kenyan coast, typically dabbed a lifestyle of the Mombasa people; “Mombasa raha”, loosely translated as “Mombasa the home of luxurious living,” and that “Mombasa hakuna haraka” meaning everything at the Kenyan coast is done with no haste.  So when I got the opportunity to work with these two counties, I knew I had the perfect opportunity to learn about the Kenyan coast. At the same time, it dawned on me that I was in for a hard task. At this time, in 2018 April, I was walking into a society that had been declared by the Kenyan Government, just few months ago, as food insecure deserving food relief from the government since it had insufficient produce. I did a quick background check in the community and found out that despite being hunger prone, the community had grown Cassava crop since time immemorial. At this point I convinced myself that all was not lost. Hence I consoled myself that, the work could not be as hard but a little motivation to the farmers would help us to contribute to the actualization of two SDGs of Food and Nutritional security and eradication of poverty within this community.

My interaction with the coastal farm households for the last one year has taught me and motivated me to be committed even further to the African Agenda 2063. The local farmers are committed to getting and adopting the new technologies presented to them by either the NGO’s, Banks and research institutions such as universities, Kenya Agriculture and Livestock Organization (KALRO) and others.  Notably, the commitment of Kilifi county Extension officers Mr. Nyinge and Mr. Mwadzua is quite commendable. The first trip during the focus group, remarkably, Mr. Nyinge knew about 100 farmers by name, farmer group, homestead and some by their children names. The few questions he kept asking the farmers were, “Hello mama Y, how are the fruit trees we gave you fairing?” This became a chorus as we navigated the county. In this officer, I learnt that community interaction calls for meeting the farmers at their farms, moving a notch high to associate with them at personal level and sharing with them their experiences.   The up close interaction with the farmers showed an open interaction between the Extension officer and the farmers.  This way, the farmers learned while being motivated and with a clear focus of making money from agriculture while feeding their families."
hotel review – travel,"[Hotel Review] Parkroyal on Beach Road Singapore
ON OCTOBER 21, 2019 BY SATU KOSONGIN EXECUTIVE CLUB LOUNGE, GHA DISCOVERY, ORCHID CLUB, PARKROYAL HOTELS, SINGAPORE, STAYCATIONS
parkroyal beach road
Grabbed from Parkroyal Beach Road’s official site
My previous experience in this property was back in 2011. With the recently completed refurbishment and glowing pictures and reviews online, I decided to take advantage of the Amex Plat offer for getting $100 back with every $300 spent at Pan Pacific Group of Hotels, which includes Parkroyal properties. And being able to stack my GHA Black benefits was a bonus for sure!
Address – 7500 Beach Road Singapore 199591. Website.
 We are making a random film about this. Book for free HERE! https://my7.travel.blog/awesome/
Contact – Tel: +65 6296 3600. Email: enquiry.prsin@parkroyalhotels.com.Location – the property is located along Beach Road, right opposite Haji Lane and its neighbouring alleys. Concourse is right next door which gives you access to a comparatively sad handful of F&B. Then you get The Plaza which is the smallish block of F&B located to the behind of the hotel. But all these places are un-sheltered access which means rain will cause plenty inconvenience. Nearest major mall will be Suntec City which is about10mins unsheltered way away.Price – SGD183.60++ = SGD$210nett for 2 pax under the Member’s 14 Days Advanced Purchase rate. One of the cheaper staycation rates in Singapore.

Prior to Arrival – with this rate in mind, I emailed the hotel to confirm the possibilities of the double upgrade so I know which room to book. The reservations team responded to confirm that GHA Blacks’ highest upgrade possibility is the Club Premier: the next higher (and highest category for the property) is the Executive Suite which is excluded for upgrades. So I picked the Deluxe room, hoping to snag a double upgrade to the Club Premier. What I wish they could have told me is that GHA Black upgrade does not include access to Orchid Club – which I’ll talk about below.bb5883c7e2629550-photo-full
4862fb9d2729c18e-photo-full51968066a758b49d-photo-full
Check In – Arrived at 1:30pm on a Saturday afternoon to a bright and colorful lobby and was attended to immediately. The staff confirmed that I had received a double upgrade to Orchid Club Premier and also confirmed my late check out at 6pm. At the end of the process, I confirmed that club access is for 2pax – only to be told that the upgrade does not include access to Orchid Club and that I’d have to top up for it. I was quoted $56++ for 2pax which I thought was very reasonable since it includes breakfast and evening cocktails amongst others. I paid the extra but was not given letter stating the club benefits and timings.Now, let me be clear that I do know that lounge access is not a guaranteed benefit for GHA Blacks. I just wish the property could be a little more transparent about the upgrade being only in terms of hardware but not club access. If I were to be honest, I don’t really agree with the principle since there is no such category of “club rooms without club access”. But sure, the hotel can decide to tweak at discretion. But stating this info upfront would have been a much better experience for guests – the reservations team or the front desk could have been pro-active in relaying this crucial piece of information rather than wait until I ask. I’m sure I’m not the only person who would have assumed all club rooms come with club access and it would have a terrible embarrassment if I had attempted to access the club with this assumption.
